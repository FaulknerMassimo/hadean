# Hadean

Hadean is a bottom-up artificial-life simulation written in Rust. A generated,
mass-balanced chemistry lives in a lit, heated, flowing pond; protocells take
those compounds across a membrane, catalyse a downhill reaction, grow, divide,
die, and decompose back into the same chemistry.

The simulation is deterministic and energy-audited. There are no food tokens or
untracked life points: matter and energy remain part of the world throughout a
cell's lifecycle.

## Current state

- L0 substrate: units, counter-based randomness, fixed time, state hashing
- L1 chemistry: atom graphs, generated reversible reactions, catalysis
- L2 fields: conservative diffusion/advection, heat, light, static flow
- L4 protocell (pre-genome): membrane transport, metabolism, maintenance,
  Brownian motion, division, death, decomposition
- Headless CLI, compressed snapshots, replay verification, CSV telemetry
- Population-curve analysis: boom, bust and recovery read out of a run rather
  than asserted

The current milestone is the Phase 2 population gate: a population that grows
into its food supply, crashes, and recovers. The machinery to judge it is in
place and the energetics are sized against the pond's measured photochemical
output. `configs/gate.toml` holds the best configuration so far: it grows into
its food supply, holds there for three days and nights without a single death,
and then takes a genuine die-off — 136 cells to 26, with a hundred and ten
corpses decomposing. **The survivors do not yet come back, so the gate is not
met.** HANDOFF.md has the whole diagnosis, what each dial does, and the two
candidate fixes. After that comes the L3 genome, which replaces the protocell's
hardcoded traits.

## Run it

The Rust toolchain is pinned locally with [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/):

```sh
mise install
mise exec -- cargo run -p hadean-headless --release -- run \
  --config configs/pond.toml --ticks 10000 --progress 1000
```

Useful commands:

```sh
mise exec -- cargo run -p hadean-headless --release -- config
mise exec -- cargo run -p hadean-headless --release -- chem --reactions
mise exec -- cargo run -p hadean-headless --release -- profile --ticks 2000
mise exec -- cargo run -p hadean-headless --release -- verify --ticks 2000
mise exec -- cargo run -p hadean-headless --release -- ecology \
  --config configs/gate.toml --ticks 250000
mise exec -- cargo test --release --workspace
```

`verify` is the conservation gate: bit-identical replay, a clean save/reload,
and an energy audit that does not drift. `ecology` is the population gate: it
runs a world, draws its population and food curves, and exits non-zero unless
the population grew into its food supply, overshot it, crashed, and recovered
without ever leaning on the safety cap.

Runs can emit audit/population telemetry with `--csv runs/pond.csv` and resume
bit-identically through `--out runs/pond.snap` / `--resume runs/pond.snap`.

`configs/pond.toml` is the world at full size; `configs/gate.toml` is the same
world at an eighth of the volume, which is where the population gate is tuned
and where it runs in twenty minutes rather than an afternoon. Everything but
the grid and the cell lifecycle numbers is identical, and a test enforces that.

## The sun has to move

`configs/pond.toml` runs a ten-minute day. That is not decoration. There was
briefly a second preset that fixed the sun in the sky, on the theory that it
made a population crash unambiguously about resources rather than about
nightfall. It made the pond uninhabitable: under a fixed sun the compound the
ancestor eats builds to a peak and then decays to nothing, because the
photoreaction drains its own precursor and nothing regenerates it. The night is
what lets the chemistry recover. In this world the day/night cycle is not a
confound in the experiment, it is the experiment's renewable resource.
